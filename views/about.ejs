  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Sushant Bhairu Awalekar</strong>, a B.Tech Computer Science student at <strong>TKIET Warananagar</strong>.
    After scoring 56% in my 12th, I committed myself to growth, learning, and skill development. I’ve built a strong foundation
    in programming, full-stack development, and problem-solving through self-driven projects and continuous learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm deeply passionate about <strong>AI, web development, and digital transformation</strong>. I enjoy building tech that makes a real difference.
    My goal is to become a skilled <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who contributes to meaningful, inclusive, and innovative digital solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m always exploring new technologies, seeking opportunities to grow, and working on projects that challenge my thinking. Whether it’s
    developing apps, solving problems, or learning new frameworks, I’m constantly pushing myself forward.
